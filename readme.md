## File Structure Explanation

- The file structure of this project consists of the following components: assets, pages, index.html, and README.md. Inside the assets folder, there css, docs, img, js subfolders. The pages folder contains four pages: about-me, education, previous-works, and contact. Each of these pages has its own assets folder that also contains css, img, js and an index.html file.


## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
